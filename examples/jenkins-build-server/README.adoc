This guide assumes you have already created a project to build and deploy.
We will start with the `parsing-with-spec` example project provided in this repository.
Jenkins is presented because it is free and well documented.
The steps in this guide can be adapted to other build tools and services.


== Overview

* How Clojure projects are built and executed locally
* How to set up a build server to automate test/build/deploy


== Building and Executing Clojure projects

    lein run

    lein uberjar

    java -jar myapp.jar

    lein ring uberjar

    lein install

    lein deploy


== lein run

* Easy to execute
* May need to pull dependencies


== lein uberjar

* Your application and all dependencies in a single JAR file
* Easy to deploy
* Easy to execute
* Versioned
* Preservable


== java -jar myapp.jar

* Executes an uberjar
* Define a main entrypoint in project.clj

    :main myapp.core

src/myapp/core.clj

    (ns myapp.core)
    (defn -main [& args] ...)

* Alternatively, specify an entrypoint from the commandline

    java -jar myapp.jar -m myapp.core/-main

== lein ring uberjar

Sets up a main entry point to start the webservice

Equivalent to

    (ns myapp.core)
    (defn -main [& args]
      (run-jetty handler {:port 3000}))


== lein install

* Builds an uberjar and puts it in your local Maven repository `~/.m2`
* Useful for testing library snapshots and building from source
* Does not publish your artifact


== lein deploy

* Publishes your artifact to a repository
* Repositories can be
  - public (Clojars, Maven Central)
  - private (Hosted/S3/Self managed)
* https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/DEPLOY.md
* Easy... if you have a repository...
* Not the same as deploying your application!


== Where to publish artifacts to?

* Amazon S3 is a low-maintenance choice:
  - https://github.com/s3-wagon-private/s3-wagon-private
* Artifactory/Nexus/Archiva
* Deps: https://www.deps.co/
* Remeber to include a `repositories` section in your project.clj
  - To publish to a private repository
  - To pull dependencies from a private repository

    :repositories [["private" {:url "s3p://mybucket/releases/" :no-auth true}]]


== Deploying a Clojure application

* Build an uberjar (or Docker container)
* Get the artifact to the host server
* Run it


== Implementation details are driven by architecture

* Tomcat? Drop a WAR in a folder
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk? Roll out a new docker container
* AWS Lambda? Upload a new JAR
* Kubernetes? Roll out a new docker container
* Heroku? Deploy from git


== Creating a build server overview

* Install Jenkins
* Install Leiningen
* Add a build


== What is Docker?

* Virtualization
* Dockerfile specifies a parent and setup tasks
* Building starts with an image and runs the setup tasks, creates a container
* Run a container and it behaves like a stand alone computer


== Handy Docker commands

* `docker build -t <image-name> .` to create a container from a Dockerfile
* `docker run <image-name>` to run it
* `docker ps` to see running containers
* `docker exec -ti <container-id> bash` to get a shell in a running container
* `docker stop <container-id>` to stop it


== Creating a Jenkins server inside a Docker container

* Install docker
* Create a Dockerfile to extend the base Jenkins image
  - see examples/jenkins-build-server/Dockerfile
  - https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/README.md
  - add steps to install Leiningen
* Create a Makefile or similar to automate tasks
  - see examples/jenkins-build-server/Makefile
  - `make run` to start the server
* Open the UI: http://localhost:8080/
* Enter password from console log
* Install suggested plugins
* Create admin user


== What to build?

* An uberjar
* Docker image


== Set up Job

* Choose Freestyle project
* Configure source code management
  - parsing-with-spec is a subdirectory of the enterprise-clojure repository
  - `sparse checkout path` only gets a subdirectory
* Under "Build", add build steps, shell command
  - `cd examples/parsing-with-spec && lein test`
  - `cd examples/parsing-with-spec && lein install`
  - or docker build
  - don't need to change directory if project is in root
* Save
* Build now
* Check the console logs
  - tests passed
  - jar created


== Versioning


== Running the built artifacts

* `java -jar myapp.jar`
* Use environment variables to behave differently
* Can extend a prebuilt docker image (or roll your own)


== Building multiple services

* Set up jobs for each project


== Set up another triggered Job to deploy to CI

* If the build succeeds, deploy
